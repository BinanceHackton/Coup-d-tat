## Project Introduction

###### Game Overview
* Our game is called "Resistance Girls", a medieval-themed card game featuring adorable young girls. Each card represents a different class in society, including kings, nobles, knights, and commoners, forming a hierarchical structure akin to a food chain. 

* The King card can defeat noble and knight cards, the noble card can defeat knight and commoner cards, the knight card can only defeat the commoner card, while the commoner card can capture the king card.

###### Preparation Phase Before Startiong the Game
* In order to participate in the game, players need to exchange a certain amount of BNB coins for NFT tickets within the game. The NFT tickets come in three different types: Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each with a different price

###### Game Entry Phase
* Players proceed to enter the game room that matches the ticket they own and participate in the game by wagering the submitted ticket. As all tickets are NFTs, if a player loses a ticket, they will transfer the NFT to the opponent.

###### Game Ending Phase
* Once the game is concluded and a winnier is determined, the winnier receives both their own wagered NFT and the opponent's wagered NFT ticket. These tickets can be exchanged for BNB coins at the exchange center.

Additionally, the winner will be rewarded with a certain amount of points, the loser will lose a certain amount of points, which will be recorded in the rankings.

###### Game Rules
* The game is played in a 1v1 format a total of 9 rounds. In each round, both players must choose and play one card from their own deck. Each deck consists of 2 king cards, 2 noble cards, 2 knight cards, and 3 commoner cards. When a player's card defeats the opponent's card, the player is awared 1 point. If cards of the same rank are played, it results in a draw and both players are awarded 0 points. 

* However, if a commoner card captures a king card, it awards 2 points to encourage psychological and strategic battles between players. The game follows a point-based system, so in the event of a tie, the player who captured more king cards with commoner cards will be declared the winner.

## Goals/Expected Impact

###### Goals
* The game operates in the Play to Earn (P2E) sector, which is a prominent area within the blockchain gaming industry. Players have the opportunity to earn money through game victories, and even if they experience losses, they can still purchase tickets to acquire NFTs and build their collection.

###### Expected Impact
* This type of game differs from traditional P2E games as it places less emphasis on luck and more on player strategy and psychology during gameplay. Additionally, outside of the gameplay itself, the implementation of a collection system further encourages player engagement.

## Development Plan
* In our project, we plan to further enhance the NFT ticket minting process by incorporating the genetic concept seen in CryptoKitties. This means that each ticket will be minted uniquely and stored in the collection upon issuance.

* The introduction of a ranking system will encourage player participation, and players with high rankings will receive special NFTs that are exclusively issued, providing them with a richer collection experience.
